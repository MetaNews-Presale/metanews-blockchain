# MetaVerify Vanity Names

*Last updated: March 2025*

---

## 🔍 Overview

**MetaVerify Vanity Names** bring human-readable identities to the **MetaNews Blockchain**.  
They replace long wallet addresses with short, brandable names.

Each name acts as an on-chain identity token — integrating directly with **MetaVerify** the **Verified Tick Utility** to display verification status, ownership, and related metadata.

---

## 🧭 Objectives

- Simplify blockchain identities with readable and memorable names.  
- Link verified badges and reputation data to public wallet identities.  
- Enable users and organizations to claim unique digital handles under the `.meta`, `.verify`, and `.news` namespaces.  
- Create a sustainable, MET-powered registration and renewal model.

## 🧩 System Overview

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Vanity Name NFT** | ERC-721 token representing ownership of a human-readable identity. |
| **Resolver Contract** | Maps the name to wallet addresses and badge status. |
| **Metadata** | Stores verification status, social links, and optional profile info. |
| **API Endpoints** | Resolve names ↔ wallets ↔ badges for apps, explorers, and integrations. |

---

## 🔤 Naming Conventions

| Namespace | Intended Use |
|------------|--------------|
| **.meta** | General-purpose personal and creator identities. |
| **.verify** | Verified users, brands, and organizations. |
| **.news** | Publishers, journalists, and creators in the MetaNews ecosystem. |

---

## ⚙️ Minting & Ownership Flow

1. **User connects a wallet** on the MetaNews Blockchain.  
2. **Chooses an available name** (e.g., `alex.meta`).  
3. **Pays registration fee in MET** — triggering the NFT mint.  
4. **Ownership recorded on-chain** via ERC-721 smart contract.  
5. **Optional**: Link verified social accounts to display the verified tick badge.  

Each minted name is **fully transferable**, allowing secondary-market sales or ownership migration.

---

## 🔗 Integration with Verification

- Each name can **display a verified badge** once the wallet completes the Verified Tick process.  
- The name record stores and exposes:  
  - Wallet address  
  - Verification badge status (Verified / Revoked / Pending)  
  - Associated profile metadata  

Public APIs allow any third-party app or dApp to instantly resolve this data.

## 💰 Economic Model (Illustrative)

> *All prices below are examples and subject to change prior to public launch.*

| Type | Example Fee | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Base Registration** | `10 MET / year` | Standard name registration (renewable). |
| **Premium Names** | Auction-based | Short or high-demand names. |
| **Renewal** | Annual MET payment | Names must be renewed each year. |

**Revenue Allocation (illustrative):**
- 60% → Treasury (ecosystem growth)
- 40% → Burn (MET deflation)

Final fee model and revenue distribution will be announced closer to release.

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Smart Contract** | ERC-721 ownership + resolver mapping. |
| **Resolver** | Translates `.meta`, `.verify`, or `.news` to wallet addresses and badge data. |
| **Frontend Integration** | “Claim your .meta name” within the MetaVerify dashboard. |
| **APIs** | REST/GraphQL endpoints to resolve name-to-wallet and wallet-to-name mappings. |
| **Profile Pages** | Accessible via URLs such as `username.meta.news`. |

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **GET /resolve/{name}** | Returns wallet address and badge status. |
| **GET /reverse/{wallet}** | Returns all vanity names linked to a wallet. |

These endpoints enable instant verification and reputation lookups for wallets, organizations, or brands across the MetaNews ecosystem.

---

## 👤 User Flow Example

1. User connects wallet.  
2. Searches for an available name (`creator.meta`).  
3. Confirms registration and pays in MET.  
4. Name is minted on-chain and displayed in their profile.  
5. If the wallet is verified, a badge appears next to the name.  

---

## 💎 Use Cases

| Category | Example | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Individuals** | `sara.meta` | Personal blockchain identity linked to verified socials. |
| **Businesses** | `acme.verify` | Corporate verification and public trust proof. |
| **Creators** | `studio.news` | Publisher identity for verified media releases. |
| **Integrations** | Exchanges, dApps | Display verified names instead of raw addresses. |

---

## 🧩 Future Features

- Integration with **organizational attestations** (linking names to company-issued proofs).  
- **Name migration** support for wallet replacements.  
- Integration with **AI-powered trust scores** from the upcoming MetaVerify Reputation Layer.  
- **On-chain auctions** for premium and reserved names.  

---

## 📜 Conclusion

The **MetaVerify Vanity Names** system brings readability, authenticity, and brand recognition to blockchain identities.  
By combining NFTs, AI verification, and MET token economics, it builds a user-owned identity layer for the decentralized media and creator economy.
