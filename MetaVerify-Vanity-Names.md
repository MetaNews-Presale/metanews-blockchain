_Last updated: March 2025_

---

## üîç Overview

**MetaVerify Vanity Names** bring human-readable identities to the **MetaNews Blockchain**.  
They replace long wallet addresses with short, brandable names.

Each name acts as an on-chain identity token ‚Äî integrating directly with **MetaVerify** the **Verified Tick Utility** to display verification status, ownership, and related metadata.

---

## üß≠ Objectives

- Simplify blockchain identities with readable and memorable names.
- Link verified badges and reputation data to public wallet identities.
- Enable users and organizations to claim unique digital handles under the `.meta`, `.verify`, and `.news` namespaces.
- Create a sustainable, MET-powered registration and renewal model.

## üß© System Overview

| Component             | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vanity Name NFT**   | ERC-721 token representing ownership of a human-readable identity.      |
| **Resolver Contract** | Maps the name to wallet addresses and badge status.                     |
| **Metadata**          | Stores verification status, social links, and optional profile info.    |
| **API Endpoints**     | Resolve names ‚Üî wallets ‚Üî badges for apps, explorers, and integrations. |

## üî§ Naming Conventions

| Namespace   | Intended Use                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **.meta**   | General-purpose personal and creator identities.                 |
| **.verify** | Verified users, brands, and organizations.                       |
| **.news**   | Publishers, journalists, and creators in the MetaNews ecosystem. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Minting & Ownership Flow

1. **User connects a wallet** on the MetaNews Blockchain.
2. **Chooses an available name** (e.g., `alex.meta`).
3. **Pays registration fee in MET** ‚Äî triggering the NFT mint.
4. **Ownership recorded on-chain** via ERC-721 smart contract.
5. **Optional**: Link verified social accounts to display the verified tick badge.

Each minted name is **fully transferable**, allowing secondary-market sales or ownership migration.

---

## üîó Integration with Verification

- Each name can **display a verified badge** once the wallet completes the Verified Tick process.
- The name record stores and exposes:
  - Wallet address
  - Verification badge status (Verified / Revoked / Pending)
  - Associated profile metadata

Public APIs allow any third-party app or dApp to instantly resolve this data.
