# MetaNews Blockchain Architecture Overview

_Last updated: March 2025_

---

## üß≠ Introduction

**MetaNews Blockchain** is a next-generation Layer-2 blockchain designed to power a decentralized ecosystem for news, media, and content verification.  
It combines scalability, security, and cost efficiency through **Arbitrum Orbit** and a **custom gas token (MET)**, providing the performance of an L2 with the trust of Ethereum.

---

## üß± Architectural Components Overview

The MetaNews Blockchain L2 network consists of four primary layers:

| Component                                      | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom Token for Gas Fees**                  | Native MET token used for transaction fees, enabling a tailored economic model. |
| **Rollup Framework: Arbitrum Orbit**           | Optimistic rollup technology for high throughput and low fees.                  |
| **Settlement Layer: Ethereum L1**              | Provides the security anchor and final settlement.                              |
| **Data Availability Layer: Arbitrum AnyTrust** | Ensures off-chain data remains verifiable and accessible for fraud proofs.      |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Component Analysis

### 3.1 Custom Token for Gas Fees

**Purpose:**  
The native **MET** token serves as the gas token for the MetaNews Blockchain L2 network.  
This enables a sustainable ecosystem where transaction fees directly reinforce the network's economy.

**Highlights:**

- ERC-20 standard, compatible with all major Ethereum tools and wallets.
- Non-rebasing, no transfer fees ‚Äî ensures stable transaction behavior.
- Natively bridged from Ethereum for liquidity and interoperability.
- Dynamic fee parameters (base + surplus) adjustable via governance.
- Gas fees generate revenue to sustain validators and sequencers.

### 3.2 Rollup Framework: Arbitrum Orbit

**Technology Overview**

- Optimistic rollup mechanism that bundles multiple transactions off-chain and posts compressed data to Ethereum L1.
- Secured through a fraud-proof system where disputes can be raised during a challenge window.

**Technical Advantages**

- **Custom Gas Token Support:** Natively compatible with the MET token.
- **Configurable Fee Models:** Enables network-level fine-tuning.
- **High Throughput:** Aggregated transaction batches allow near-instant confirmations and reduced congestion.

---

### 3.3 Settlement Layer: Ethereum L1

**Role and Security**

- Serves as the **final security layer** for all MetaNews Blockchain L2 transactions.
- Fraud proofs are verified and finalized on Ethereum.
- Provides immutability and decentralization guarantees.

**Economic Considerations**

- Dual-fee model: MET for L2 operations, ETH for L1 data posting.
- Smooth liquidity management ensures stable conversion between tokens.
- Supports enterprise-level scalability via Conduit deployment standards.

---

### 3.4 Data Availability (DA) Layer: Arbitrum AnyTrust

**Purpose**

- Ensures that all off-chain transaction data is securely available for validation.
- Uses a **Data Availability Committee (DAC)** model for cost efficiency and verifiable access.

**Design Trade-offs**

- Slight centralization for reduced operational cost.
- Modular design enables future migration to fully decentralized DA solutions such as EigenDA or Celestia.
- Upgrade-ready to integrate with future data availability standards.

---

## üîÅ Integration & Operational Workflow

### Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Submission:** Users initiate transactions on L2, paying gas in MET.
2. **Sequencing:** Transactions are ordered, executed, and batched by the sequencer.
3. **Commitment:** Batched data is compressed and sent to Ethereum L1.
4. **Verification:** Fraud-proof mechanisms allow dispute resolution anchored to Ethereum.

### Network Economics

- Collected gas fees sustain validator and sequencer operations.
- Dynamic fee parameters ensure equilibrium between affordability and performance.
- Revenue from network activity supports long-term sustainability.

---

## üåü Strategic Advantages

- **Scalability:** High transaction throughput ideal for content-heavy ecosystems.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Off-chain batching and AnyTrust integration lower gas costs.
- **Community Incentives:** Custom token-based gas aligns with user growth and engagement.
- **Security:** Anchored on Ethereum for immutable state guarantees.
- **Flexibility:** Modular architecture allows integration of new DA or governance modules.

---

## üîÆ Future Outlook

MetaNews Blockchain L2 is engineered for long-term adaptability.  
Future upgrades include:

- Decentralized sequencer network.
- Advanced governance and staking mechanisms.
- Transition to hybrid or ZK-based DA solutions.
- Expanded support for external dApps and identity integrations.
